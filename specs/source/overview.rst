Welcome to the Carpentry documentation, it will be a pleasure to show
you how to have a very simple continuous integration running within 5
minutes.

This overview chapter will explain all the ideas behind Carpentry.

If you just want to get it running locally, check the :ref:`quickstart`

Motivation
==========

Carpentry was born out of the motivation of creating a stable
continuous integration server, and that it made very easy to set up a
build within minutes. It should also automate its own deployment and
help anyone in the world have a simple and functional CI server with
almost no effort.
